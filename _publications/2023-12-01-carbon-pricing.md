excerpt: 'How do governments regulate and price carbon use within their borders? While much of the extant literature focuses on domestic factors like country wealth and trade openness, this study contributes to research on the international political factors that determine domestic carbon pricing. In other words, how do carbon prices diffuse from one country to another? This study also extends the policy diffusion literature by using a more fine-grained dependent variable of carbon prices, rather than a binary indicator of policy adoption. A panel analysis is used to compare the variation in carbon prices among 217 countries, from 1990 to 2019. This paper finds that the prices set by a country’s immediate neighbors, region, and global prices in that year have a significant and substantively meaningful effect on a country’s carbon price. Given a \\$10 (USD) higher average carbon price among a country’s neighbors, a country is associated with having a \\$2.50 to \\$5.80 higher carbon price. This effect remains robust to standard domestic controls, types of carbon policies, and a high threshold of potential unobserved confounding. These diffusion effects remain significant but wane over time when a lag is set between the neighboring prices and the dependent variable. In all, this study shows that carbon prices are not set in isolation, but in tandem with a country’s surrounding and international community.'

Abstract: How do governments regulate and price carbon use within their borders? While much of the extant literature focuses on domestic factors like country wealth and trade openness, this study contributes to research on the international political factors that determine domestic carbon pricing. In other words, how do carbon prices diffuse from one country to another? This study also extends the policy diffusion literature by using a more fine-grained dependent variable of carbon prices, rather than a binary indicator of policy adoption. A panel analysis is used to compare the variation in carbon prices among 217 countries, from 1990 to 2019. This paper finds that the prices set by a country’s immediate neighbors, region, and global prices in that year have a significant and substantively meaningful effect on a country’s carbon price. Given a \\$10 (USD) higher average carbon price among a country’s neighbors, a country is associated with having a \\$2.50 to \\$5.80 higher carbon price. This effect remains robust to standard domestic controls, types of carbon policies, and a high threshold of potential unobserved confounding. These diffusion effects remain significant but wane over time when a lag is set between the neighboring prices and the dependent variable. In all, this study shows that carbon prices are not set in isolation, but in tandem with a country’s surrounding and international community.
