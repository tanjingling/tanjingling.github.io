excerpt: Heat pumps are an energy-efficient and increasingly cost-effective solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. However, other clean energy technologies, such as rooftop solar, are less likely to be adopted in underserved communities, and thus policies incentivizing their adoption may funnel support to well-resourced communities. Unlike previously studied technologies, the effects of heat pumps on household energy bills may be positive or negative depending on local climate, energy costs, building features, and other factors. Here, we propose a framework for assessing heat pump inequities across the US. We find that households in communities of color and with higher percentages of renters are less likely to use heat pumps across the board. Moreover, communities of color are least likely to use heat pumps in regions where they are most likely to reduce energy bills. Public policies must address these inequities to advance beneficial electrification and energy justice.

Abstract: Electrifying space heating is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector, and heat pumps have emerged as an energy-efficient and increasingly cost-effective solution. However, other clean energy technologies (e.g., rooftop solar) are less common in underserved communities, and thus policies incentivizing their adoption can be regressive. Unlike previously-studied technologies, the effects of heat pumps on energy bills may be positive or negative, and thus inequities in their access are context specific. Here we propose a framework for identifying inequities in heat pump access and map these inequities across the U.S. We find that households in communities of color and with high percentages of renters have access to heat pumps at lower rates across the board, but differences are largest in areas where heat pumps are likely to reduce energy bills. Public policies must address these inequities to advance beneficial electrification and energy justice.
