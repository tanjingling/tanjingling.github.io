I am a graduate researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's [Climate Action Lab](https://www.climateactionlab.com/). I am currently pursuing a Master's in International Public Affairs at UW as an Energy Analysis and Policy Scholar. My work focuses on unpacking the linkages between international politics and domestic energy policymaking. I previously researched at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and completed a dual Bachelor's at Sciences Po and the National University of Singapore.
