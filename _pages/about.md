I am an incoming PhD student in the Department of Government at Harvard University (Fall 2024). My research focuses on unpacking the linkages between international politics and domestic energy policymaking. I previously researched at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's [Climate Action Lab](https://www.climateactionlab.com/).

In May 2024, I completed my Master's in International Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as an Energy Analysis and Policy Scholar. 

In May 2022, I completed a Dual Bachelor's at Sciences Po and the National University of Singapore.
