I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Government at Harvard University. I am also a graduate affliate of Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS) and Center for American Political Studies (CAPS). My research examines the linkages between international politics and domestic environmental politics/policies. This includes how the international political economy, institutions, and global norms influence political behavior on climate change and vice versa. 

In May 2024, I completed my Master's in International Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as an Energy Analysis and Policy Scholar. I was a researcher at the University's [Climate Action Lab](https://www.climateactionlab.com/) and worked on projects on the energy transition and climate justice. 

In May 2022, I completed a Dual Bachelor's at Sciences Po and the National University of Singapore, where I did a research stint at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.
